Project Description
===================

``hep-ga`` is a C++11 library for efficient numeric calculations with geometric
algebra. It provides a template class for multi-vectors of G_{p,q} and
template-expressions for many operations such as addition, geometric product,
inner and outer product.

Installation and Testing
========================

``hep-ga`` is a header-only library which requires no compilation. To install
it, use the usual series of commands for autotools-based projects, for example::

    ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-doxygen
    make
    make install

This will generate the Doxygen documentation for this library first and installs
it in the second step to ``/usr/local/doc/hep-ga``. The headers are installed to
``/usr/local/include``. You may change these directories by specifying
additional options to ``./configure``. The following command gives you a
complete list of available configuration options::

    ./configure --help

If you want to run the test suite simply type::

    make check

A Note for Git Users
====================

If you have obtained the repository of this package which does not contain the
files generated by autotools ...

  - first make sure that you have a recent version of autoconf and automake
    (configure will complain if this is not the case) and
  - run ``autoreconf -fiv`` to generate the files which are not under revision
    control

Usage
=====

See doxygen documentation.
