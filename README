PROJECT DESCRIPTION
===================

hep-ga is a C++11 library for efficient numeric calculations with geometric
algebra. It provides a template class for multi-vectors of G_{p,q} and
template-expressions for many operations such as addition, geometric product,
inner and outer product.

INSTALLATION AND TESTING
========================

hep-ga is a header-only library which requires no compilation. To install it,
use the usual series of commands for autotools-based projects, for example:

    ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-doxygen
    make
    make install

This will generate the Doxygen documentation for this library first and installs
it in the second step to /usr/local/doc/hep-ga. The headers are installed to
/usr/local/include. You may change these directories by specifying additional
options to ./configure. The following command gives you a complete list of
available configuration options:

    ./configure --help

If you want to run the test-suite, first make sure to configure with
`--enable-tests' and then type

    make check

In every case you will need a C++ compiler supporting parts of C++11. At the
time of writing, only GCC 4.7 and CLANG 3.1 are capable of compiling this
library.

A NOTE FOR GIT USERS
====================

If you have obtained the repository of this package which does not contain the
files generated by autotools ...

  - first make sure that you have a recent version of autoconf and automake
    (configure will complain if this is not the case) and
  - run `autoreconf -fiv` to generate the files which are not under revision
    control

After this step you may proceed as with any other autotools project; the INSTALL
file gives detailed instructions.

USAGE
=====

See doxygen documentation.
