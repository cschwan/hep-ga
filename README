hep-ga is a C++ library for numeric calculations with Geometric Algebra. It
provides a template class for multi-vectors in G_{p,q} and template-expression
based functions for the corresponding operations, such as the geometric product,
dot product and wedge product.

For more information on how to use Hep-ga see the Doxygen documentation (pass
configure `--doxygen`).

A NOTE FOR GIT USERS
====================

If you have obtained the repository of this package which does not contain the
files generated by autotools ...

  - first make sure that you have a recent version of autoconf and automake
    (configure will complain if this is not the case) and
  - run `autoreconf -fiv` to generate the files which are not under revision
    control

After this step you may proceed as with any other autotools project; the INSTALL
file gives detailed instructions.
